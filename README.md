# Case Description
The marketing team of an e-commerce site launched an email campaign targeting a random sample of registered users. The email introduced a new feature and included a link redirecting users to the website. A successful outcome, from the marketing perspective, is defined as a user clicking on that link.
# Key Tasks & Insights
📊 1. Campaign Performance Metrics
Email Open Rate: Calculated the percentage of users who opened the email.

Click-Through Rate (CTR): Measured the percentage of users who clicked the link inside the email.

🤖 2. Predictive Modeling
Built a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a user clicking the link in the email based on available user and campaign data.

This model can be used to optimize recipient selection for future campaigns, potentially replacing the current random approach.

📈 3. Estimated Uplift in CTR
Using the trained model, we estimated the potential improvement in CTR if only the most likely users were targeted.

Designed an A/B test framework to evaluate the model’s real-world impact, comparing CTR from model-selected users vs randomly selected users.

🔍 4. Segment Analysis
Conducted detailed exploration to identify user segments that responded differently to the campaign.

Discovered insightful patterns based on factors like user activity, demographics, and past interactions, enabling more targeted and personalized campaigns.
# Outcome
By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, this project demonstrates a clear path to optimize email marketing strategies, leading to higher engagement and better resource allocation.
